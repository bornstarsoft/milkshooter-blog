The recent name change from No Code to Screen Burn marks a significant evolution for the Glasgow-based game development team. Founded by Jon McKellan and Omar Khan, the duo has made a name for themselves with critically acclaimed titles like Stories Untold and Observation. As they gear up for their next project, Silent Hill: Townfall, this rebranding reflects their growth and the addition of coding expertise to their creative process.

Jon McKellan, the founder and creative director, emphasizes that the new name better encapsulates the essence of their games, which often evoke the imperfect charm of older technology while delivering narratives that linger long after gameplay. This shift not only clarifies their identity in a crowded digital landscape but also enhances their SEO presence, a challenge they faced under their previous name.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it will be fascinating to see how Screen Burn leverages its new identity to push boundaries in storytelling and technology. Will this change resonate with their audience and attract new players?
