Nintendo's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, has reassured fans that the price of the upcoming Switch 2 will not be affected by the current surge in memory costsat least for now. This decision comes amidst rising RAM prices driven by increased demand from AI data centers, which have made supplies scarce. Furukawa emphasized that while the company is monitoring the situation closely, they are currently in discussions with suppliers to ensure a stable supply of components.

During a recent financial call, Furukawa addressed shareholder concerns about potential price revisions for the Switch 2. He stated that any decision regarding price changes would consider various factors, including profitability, market conditions, and sales trends. This comprehensive approach indicates that Nintendo is keen on maintaining a balance between hardware pricing and long-term profitability, especially as the second and third years of the Switch 2s lifecycle are critical for its success.

As the gaming community eagerly awaits the Switch 2, it will be interesting to see how Nintendo navigates these challenges. Will they hold firm on pricing, or will market conditions force their hand?
