SEGA is set to celebrate the half-anniversary of Persona5: The Phantom X with an exciting update that introduces Justine and Caroline, beloved characters from the original Persona 5. This update, scheduled for December 25, marks a significant milestone for the free-to-play gacha game, bringing fresh content and a simultaneous worldwide reveal that fans have eagerly awaited.

As players gear up for update 2.7, they can look forward to a special Persona X-Stream on December 23, where more details about the new characters and their abilities will be unveiled.
