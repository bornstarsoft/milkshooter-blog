Nintendo has just announced the release of Drag x Drive, an innovative basketball game for the Nintendo Switch 2, set to launch on August 14, 2025, for $30 AUD. What makes this game particularly intriguing is its unique control scheme, which utilizes the Joy-Con controllers in mouse mode to simulate arm movements, allowing players to steer and drive a wheelchair in a dynamic 3-on-3 basketball setting.

Having had the chance to play Drag x Drive for about thirty minutes at the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience in Melbourne, I was genuinely impressed by how well the mouse controls functioned. The gameplay was far more exhilarating than I had anticipated from its initial reveal video, showcasing the potential for innovative control schemes in gaming.

As we approach the release date, excitement is building around Drag x Drive. Will this game redefine how we think about sports games on consoles? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below!
