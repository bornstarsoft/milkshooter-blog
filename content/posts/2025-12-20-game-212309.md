In an unexpected twist, Assassin's Creed Shadows has emerged as the best-selling console game of 2025, excluding sports titles and shooters. This revelation comes from a recent report by analysts at Newzoo, who analyzed console game sales and highlighted the top ten best-selling projects. Despite facing criticism, Ubisoft's latest installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise has managed to capture the attention of gamers worldwide.

The sales chart is predominantly filled with established franchises, including popular titles from Electronic Arts and the Battlefield series, alongside games like Borderlands, MLB The Show, and Pokemon. However, Assassin's Creed Shadows stands out as a notable success story, proving that even amidst skepticism, a game can resonate with players and achieve remarkable sales figures.

As we look ahead, it will be interesting to see how this trend evolves and what it means for the future of the Assassin's Creed franchise. Will Shadows pave the way for more innovative titles or will it face stiff competition from upcoming releases? Only time will tell.
