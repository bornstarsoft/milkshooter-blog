In a recent discussion at the G-Star game developer convention, Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii expressed his enthusiasm for incorporating AI chatbots into future games. He envisions a gaming experience where players can solve mysteries or engage in quiz games alongside a virtual partner powered by AI, enhancing the narrative and interactive elements of gameplay.

Horii highlighted the potential of AI, specifically mentioning ChatGPT, as a tool that could revolutionize how players interact with game characters. He imagines scenarios where players could interrogate AI-driven characters to uncover clues, making the gaming experience more immersive and engaging. This innovative approach could redefine storytelling in video games, allowing for dynamic conversations that adapt to player choices.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, the integration of AI could lead to groundbreaking developments. Will we soon see games where our virtual companions are as engaging as real-life friends? The future of gaming looks promising, and we can't wait to see how these ideas come to fruition.
