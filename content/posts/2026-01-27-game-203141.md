In an intriguing turn of events, Walmart may have inadvertently revealed two unannounced GameCube titles set to join the Nintendo Switch Online library. According to reports from social media users, a snapshot from Walmart's website showcases Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2 among the games available for the service. While this could simply be a clerical error, it raises exciting possibilities for Nintendo fans eager for classic titles.

Currently, the GameCube library on Nintendo Switch Online is exclusive to Switch 2 users, with only eight titles available. Nintendo has confirmed the upcoming addition of Super Mario Sunshine, Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Pokmon Colosseum, but no release dates have been provided. The potential inclusion of Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2 would certainly enhance the nostalgia factor for gamers who grew up with these classics.

As we await official confirmation from Nintendo, the excitement surrounding these potential additions highlights the enduring appeal of GameCube games. Will we see these titles make their way to the platform soon? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the anticipation is palpable among the gaming community.
