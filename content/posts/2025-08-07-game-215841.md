In a significant move for the gaming community, HoYoverse has announced that support for Genshin Impact on PS4 will officially end on April 8, 2026. This decision stems from hardware performance limitations and the growing size of the platform's application, prompting a phased discontinuation that begins with the game's removal from the PlayStation Store on September 10, 2025. Players who have previously downloaded the game will still be able to access it, but new users will face restrictions.

The discontinuation will unfold in three stages: first, the game will be removed from the store; next, in-game purchases will be delisted by February 25, 2026; and finally, all update support will cease in April 2026. While this may seem like a setback for PS4 users, the PS5 version of Genshin Impact will continue to operate normally, allowing players to transition without losing their progress.

As the gaming landscape evolves, this decision highlights the challenges developers face in maintaining compatibility with older hardware. With the gaming community's focus shifting towards next-gen consoles, how will players adapt to these changes? Will you be making the leap to PS5 to continue your Genshin journey?
