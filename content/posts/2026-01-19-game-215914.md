SEGA is gearing up for a double celebration in 2026, marking the 35th anniversary of both Sonic the Hedgehog and Puyo Puyo. While Sonic has been in the spotlight, the announcement of the "Dairensa!" project for Puyo Puyo promises to bring fresh excitement to fans of the beloved puzzle game. With a special live stream event planned and various pop-up stores across Japan, SEGA is clearly committed to making this anniversary memorable.

The festivities will kick off with a live stream on February 1, 2026, featuring voice actors and exclusive game demos. Additionally, fans can look forward to a Puyo Puyo pop-up store in major Japanese cities, showcasing themed merchandise and limited-edition items. The collaboration between Sonic and Puyo Puyo, including a lottery with unique prizes, further highlights SEGA's innovative approach to celebrating its iconic franchises.

As we look ahead to this exciting year for SEGA, it raises the question: how will these anniversaries shape the future of gaming and fan engagement?
