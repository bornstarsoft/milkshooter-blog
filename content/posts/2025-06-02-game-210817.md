In a recent episode of the AnsweRED podcast, CD Projekt Red co-founder Marcin Iwiński shared a crucial insight: the importance of staying focused on what you do best. As the studio behind beloved titles like The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077, Iwiński emphasized that their experience has taught them to resist the temptation to venture into unfamiliar genres or features. This commitment to their core competency is not just a strategy; it's a necessity for maintaining the high standards their fans expect.

Iwiński and joint-CEO Adam Badowski discussed the challenges of game production, highlighting that while innovation is exciting, it can lead to dilution of quality if not aligned with the studio's strengths. They acknowledged that the gaming landscape is filled with enticing ideas, but spreading themselves too thin could jeopardize their ability to deliver exceptional experiences. Instead, their strategy is to focus on developing AAA, narrative-driven open-world RPGs, ensuring that every project receives the full attention it deserves.

As CD Projekt Red moves forward with the preproduction of the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, it will be interesting to see how this laser-focused approach influences their upcoming titles. Will they continue to redefine the RPG genre, or will they explore new avenues while staying true to their roots? Only time will tell.
