Circle Games, an Istanbul-based mobile game studio, has successfully raised $7.25 million in seed funding, led by Bitkraft Ventures, to enhance its mobile puzzle game portfolio. This funding will not only help them scale their debut title, Sort Express, but also expand their team, which currently consists of 12 talented individuals. The studio is keen on innovating within the casual mobile puzzle genre, an area that has seen tremendous growth and competition in recent years.

CEO Gokturk Balkc emphasized the importance of meeting player expectations in terms of visuals and user experience, stating that the competition today is significantly fiercer than it was a decade ago. With a strong background in game development from companies like Gram Games and Dream Games, the Circle Games team is well-equipped to push the boundaries of mobile puzzle gaming. Their focus on introducing new mechanics and enhancing player retention strategies could very well position them as a leading force in Turkiye's gaming landscape.
