In a bold move to raise awareness about the gender pay gap, Mavens has launched The Balancing Act, a unique puzzle game that symbolizes the frustration of Australias 21.8% pay disparity. This innovative training tool not only engages participants in a fun and interactive way but also serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing challenges women face in the workforce. By removing 22 pieces from a 500-piece jigsaw, the game effectively illustrates the imbalance that exists in pay equity.

Created by a talented team including Leah Morris, Feryx Lim, and Evelyn Tran, The Balancing Act aims to foster conversations around gender pay inequity. As players grapple with the incomplete puzzle, they are encouraged to reflect on the systemic barriers that contribute to the gender pay gap. This creative approach not only educates but also empowers organizations to take actionable steps toward achieving workplace equality.

The game comes with essential resources that clarify the difference between equal pay and the gender pay gap, helping to dispel common misconceptions. As we look to the future, its crucial for businesses to engage in meaningful discussions and implement strategies that promote fairness and equality in the workplace. Will your organization take the challenge to balance the scales?
