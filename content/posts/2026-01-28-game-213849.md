Highguard, the newly launched free-to-play shooter, has made headlines by attracting nearly 100,000 concurrent players on its first day on Steam. However, this impressive figure is somewhat overshadowed by the game's reception, which includes over 13,000 negative reviews. This stark contrast raises questions about player expectations and the challenges facing new IPs in a competitive gaming landscape.

Despite the strong player count, only 32.05% of the reviews are positive, with many players criticizing the game's large map size for its 3vs3 matchups. Developed by Wildlight Entertainment, a studio formed by veterans from popular franchises like Apex Legends and Call of Duty, Highguard's launch has sparked discussions about what it takes to succeed in today's gaming market. As the dust settles, it will be interesting to see how the developers respond to player feedback and whether they can turn the tide in favor of their ambitious new title.

What does this mixed reception mean for the future of Highguard and its developers? Only time will tell, but it certainly highlights the importance of community feedback in shaping the trajectory of new games.
