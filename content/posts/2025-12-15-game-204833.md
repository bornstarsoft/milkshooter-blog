Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, initially developed in 1991 by Chris Oberth and never released, is being resurrected as a fully polished cartridge edition through a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This exciting revival not only brings back a piece of gaming history but also highlights the importance of preserving our digital heritage.

Priced at $100, the 2025 release includes an authentic NES cartridge and a detailed manual that chronicles the games troubled past, Oberths career, and the broader challenges of preserving 8-bit history. With profits supporting the Video Game History Foundations archival efforts, this project serves as a reminder of the value of keeping our gaming legacies alive for future generations.

As we look forward to the release, one cant help but wonder: what other hidden gems from the past are waiting to be discovered and shared with the world? Let's keep our eyes peeled for more surprises in the gaming universe!
