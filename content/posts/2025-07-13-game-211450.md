Attention gamers! The indie horror game Haus Of Irndrous is currently available for free on Steam, but time is running out. Developed by Yxtopia Studios, this atmospheric horror puzzle game will transition to a paid model with a price tag of $1.99 starting July 19, 2025. If you haven't added it to your library yet, you have until July 19 to claim your copy at no cost!

Initially launched in early access in August 2024, Haus Of Irndrous was designed to be an episodic experience, with the first chapter always intended to be free. However, due to the need for funding future chapters and server support, Yxtopia Studios has decided to implement this new pricing model. The recent update 17.0 has also introduced various improvements, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

This shift from free-to-play to a paid model is not uncommon in the gaming industry, as seen with other titles like ROTA: Bend Gravity. As we look ahead, it will be interesting to see how this change impacts the game's development and player engagement. Will you be claiming your free copy before its too late?
