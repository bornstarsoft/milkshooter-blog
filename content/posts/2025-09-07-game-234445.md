The upcoming collaboration between The Pokmon Company and the Lego Group is generating significant buzz, especially with the announcement of a staggering $649.99 Lego set. This set, featuring 6,838 pieces, is poised to become one of the largest and most expensive Lego sets ever produced. Fans are already speculating about what could possibly justify such a price tag, with theories ranging from a complete collection of the original 151 Pokmon to an elaborate replica of Pallet Town.

While the first wave of Lego Pokmon sets will include a more modest 587-piece set priced at $59.99 and a 2,050-piece set for $199.99, its the colossal set that has everyone talking. According to insiders, it will take the form of a foot-high empty wallet with a winking Pikachu peeking out, a whimsical design that perfectly captures the playful spirit of both brands.

As we look forward to the official launch in 2026, it raises the question: what other surprises might this collaboration hold? With the excitement building, it seems like the perfect time to start planning your Lego Pokmon collection!
