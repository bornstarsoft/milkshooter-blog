After much anticipation, Bungie has officially announced the release date and pricing for its upcoming extraction shooter, Marathon. Set to launch in March 2026, the game will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, priced at $39.99. This announcement comes after a delay that allowed the developers to refine the game based on community feedback, ensuring a polished experience for players.

One of the standout features of Marathon is its commitment to a fair gaming environment, with no pay-to-win mechanics and a reward system that allows players to access all gameplay updates without expiration. This approach reflects Bungie's dedication to fostering a positive community and enhancing player engagement. With new features like proximity chat and a solo experience, Marathon is shaping up to be an exciting addition to the gaming landscape.

As we look forward to the release, its clear that Bungie is listening to its community and striving to deliver a game that resonates with players. Will Marathon live up to the hype? Only time will tell, but the anticipation is certainly building!
