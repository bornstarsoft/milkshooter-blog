Amazon Games has officially confirmed that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will be shutting down permanently in just one year, with the final day of service set for January 31, 2027. This announcement follows the company's decision to withdraw from MMO development, marking a significant shift in their gaming strategy. Players will no longer be able to purchase the game or in-game currency after mid-July 2026, leaving a bittersweet farewell for a title that once promised to redefine the MMO landscape.

The game has already been removed from digital storefronts, including Steam and the Xbox store, and while players who have purchased New World can still download it, they will not be able to play after the shutdown date. Amazon Games expressed gratitude to the community for their dedication and passion, emphasizing that the journey through Aeternum has been a shared adventure.

As we look ahead to the final year of New World, its a time for players to reflect on their experiences and the memories created within this virtual world. What will you miss most about your time in Aeternum? Let's celebrate the legacy of New World together as we prepare for its farewell.
