The PlayStation 5 is on the brink of a significant jailbreak, but it hinges on one elusive game: Star Wars: Racer Revenge. This situation mirrors past console compromises, such as the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Switch, which led to new hardware releases due to security vulnerabilities. With the recent leak of Sony's bootrom keys, hackers are now eyeing this rare title to unlock the console's potential.

Star Wars: Racer Revenge, a remastered version of a classic PlayStation 2 game, was released in limited quantities, making it a hot commodity among collectors and hackers alike. Only 8,500 physical copies were produced by Limited Run Games, causing prices to skyrocket as enthusiasts scramble to secure their copies. As the gaming community watches closely, the question remains: will this rare game lead to widespread PlayStation 5 hacks, or will Sony find a way to counteract this impending threat?
