Get ready to rethink your 9-to-5 with **Pocket Boss**, an innovative puzzle game that transforms the often mundane world of corporate data manipulation into an engaging gaming experience. Set to launch on Steam, this game was recently unveiled during the Day of the Devs showcase, capturing the attention of gamers and professionals alike. The unique premise places players in the shoes of a remote employee, navigating the demands of a relentless boss while tackling challenges that reflect the complexities of modern corporate life.

The gameplay primarily unfolds within a chat window, where players must respond to their boss's requests to alter data for profit maximization. This leads to a variety of minigames that cleverly illustrate the absurdities of corporate competition. From flinging a rival's market share off the screen to maneuvering through a chaotic stock market simulation, Pocket Boss offers a playful yet insightful commentary on the pressures of remote work and corporate strategy. Itâ€™s reminiscent of the fast-paced fun found in the WarioWare series, but with a corporate twist.

As we await the official release date, the excitement surrounding Pocket Boss is palpable. This game not only promises to entertain but also invites players to reflect on the realities of their work environments. Will you be ready to tackle the challenges of corporate life when Pocket Boss hits the shelves?
