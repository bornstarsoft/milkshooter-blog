In a bold move that has captured the attention of gamers everywhere, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This audacious comparison to the beloved Portal series sets high expectations for the upcoming title, especially given the legacy of its predecessor, which is often hailed as one of the best puzzle games in history.

While the gameâ€™s visuals and setting evoke memories of the Portal universe, the gameplay mechanics appear to draw more from titles like Qube and Qube 2. In **ChromaGun 2**, players will wield a color-changing gun to manipulate objects and solve puzzles, showcasing a unique twist on the genre. The free demo available on Steam offers a taste of what to expect, and early reviews of the original ChromaGun suggest that this sequel could be a delightful addition to the puzzle game landscape.

As we look forward to the release of ChromaGun 2, it raises an intriguing question: can indie developers fill the void left by major studios like Valve? With creativity and innovation at the forefront, Pixel Maniacs is certainly making a case for the indie scene's potential to surprise and delight gamers around the world.
