As the gaming community gears up for the 43rd annual Golden Joystick Awards, two standout titles from the Nintendo Switch 2 library, *Mario Kart World* and *Donkey Kong Bananza*, have made waves by being shortlisted for the coveted 'Console Game of the Year' award. This recognition marks a significant milestone for Nintendo's latest console, showcasing its potential to compete with heavyweights like *Death Stranding 2* and *Ghost of Ytei*.

Both games have also received nominations in other categories, with *Mario Kart World* vying for 'Best Multiplayer Game' and *Donkey Kong Bananza* competing for 'Best Audio Design'. This diverse recognition highlights the innovative gameplay and engaging experiences that Nintendo continues to deliver, even as it faces stiff competition in the gaming industry.
