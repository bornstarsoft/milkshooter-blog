The recent launch of CONCIERGE, a surrealist puzzle thriller by KODINO Artes, has captivated the gaming community with its unique blend of horror and introspective gameplay. Available now on Steam for $12.99, this game invites players to explore a fractured hotel filled with abstract realities, each presenting its own set of challenges and mysteries. The allure of CONCIERGE lies not just in its gameplay but also in the promise of a $500 bounty for the first player to solve its hidden riddle, adding an exciting layer of competition to the experience.

Players are armed with an unreliable camcorder as they navigate through six distinct rooms, each with its own rules and puzzles that defy conventional gaming logic. This nonlinear progression encourages exploration and creativity, allowing players to forge their own paths through the games intricate narrative. As co-creator Yan Boente aptly puts it, the game is designed to reignite curiosity and challenge players to think outside the box.

With its rich storytelling and immersive gameplay, CONCIERGE stands as a testament to the innovative spirit of indie game development. It invites players to not only engage with its puzzles but also to reflect on their own perceptions of reality. Are you ready to step into this enigmatic world and uncover the secrets that lie within?
