The upcoming remaster of Final Fantasy Tactics, titled The Ivalice Chronicles, is set to make significant adjustments to its original script. However, these changes are not influenced by modern societal trends or current events, as clarified by writer Yasumi Matsuno. Instead, the focus is on enhancing the narrative experience for players while preserving the essence of the beloved 1997 PS1 classic.

Matsuno elaborated on the need for a “listening-first” approach to the script, which aims to complement the new voice acting. This shift highlights the difference between written text and dialogue meant for performance, emphasizing clarity and engagement for players. Interestingly, Matsuno also acknowledged that his own growth as a writer may lead to minor rephrasings that reflect his evolving perspective over the years.

For fans who prefer the original experience, The Ivalice Chronicles will offer a Classic Version that combines the graphics and gameplay of the 1997 release with the acclaimed War of the Lions translation. This thoughtful approach aims to respect the nostalgia of long-time fans while also catering to new players. As we await the game's release on September 30th, it raises an intriguing question: how do we balance nostalgia with innovation in game remasters?
