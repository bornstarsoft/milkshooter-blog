Double Fine Productions has just announced Kiln, a unique online multiplayer pottery party brawler that promises to redefine how we think about crafting in games. Players will take on the role of a small spirit who must create their own armor out of clay, using a pottery wheel that allows for complete customization of shape and design. This innovative approach not only makes the crafting process accessible but also adds a layer of creativity to the competitive gameplay.

In Kiln, players can engage in 4v4 battles in the Quench mode, where they can throw pies or transform into explosive dynamite, showcasing their crafted armor's unique abilities. The project lead, Derek Brand, emphasizes the importance of making pot-making easy and enjoyable, allowing players to feel like masters of their craft right from the start. With a focus on community feedback post-launch, Kiln aims to evolve based on player experiences, making it a game to watch in the coming months.

As we look forward to its release later this year on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC, one can't help but wonder: how will the community shape the future of Kiln after its launch? Will it become the next big hit in multiplayer gaming?
