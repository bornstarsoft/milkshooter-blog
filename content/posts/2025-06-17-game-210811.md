The excitement is building as Six One Indie gears up for its September 2025 Showcase, set to take place on September 18. This event promises to deliver an impressive lineup of around 45 indie games, including some highly anticipated titles that have yet to be released. Following the success of the May showcase, which featured 48 games in just over an hour, fans can expect even more indie game goodness this fall.

For those who may have missed the previous showcase, the September event will also include a pre-show highlighting games that are set to release before the main event. Additionally, a Steam event will showcase around 200 games, providing developers with a fantastic platform to reach a wider audience. If you're an indie developer looking to showcase your game, mark your calendars: submissions open on June 20 and will run through July 8 at sixoneindie.com/showcase.

As the indie gaming community continues to thrive, events like the Six One Indie Showcase play a crucial role in spotlighting innovative and creative titles. What new gems will emerge from this showcase? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the indie gaming scene is alive and well.
