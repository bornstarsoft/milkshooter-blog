As a self-proclaimed neat freak, I find immense satisfaction in games that allow me to create order and beauty in virtual spaces. One such game that has caught my attention is Hozy, a delightful sandbox puzzle game that combines the best elements of popular titles like Unpacking and PowerWash Simulator. With its charming aesthetics and engaging gameplay, Hozy promises to be a haven for players who thrive on tidiness and creativity.

In Hozy, players are tasked with cleaning and decorating various rooms, starting with a blank canvas. The gameplay mechanics are straightforward yet satisfying, allowing you to swirl up garbage into floating balls before tossing them into a whimsical wheelie bin. Once the cleaning is done, the real fun begins as you unpack furniture and arrange it to your liking. Unlike Unpacking, Hozy grants you complete freedom in placing each item, making it an ideal playground for those who love to curate their environments.

While the game is still in development and lacks a release date, the playtest experience has left me eagerly anticipating its launch. With its detailed design and relaxing gameplay, Hozy is set to become a favorite for anyone who enjoys creating order in a chaotic world. What are you looking forward to in the gaming landscape of 2026?
