The upcoming release of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has gamers buzzing, especially with the inclusion of a remake of the original games infamous Guy Savage demo, developed by Platinum Games. This mini-game, a nostalgic nod to fans of the series, was initially a hidden Easter Egg in the original PS2 version and serves as a testament to the franchise's rich history.

Originally conceived as a proof of concept for a full game, the Guy Savage demo showcases the creativity of Konami veteran Shuyo Murata, who directed the original. Players can unlock this mini-game by completing the main game or by triggering it after a specific scene, adding an extra layer of excitement for those who delve into the narrative.

As we approach the August 28 release date on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, the anticipation builds not just for the main storyline but for the nostalgic elements that remind us why Metal Gear Solid has remained a beloved franchise. Will the inclusion of this mini-game satisfy long-time fans and attract new players alike? Only time will tell.
