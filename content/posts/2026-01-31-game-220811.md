A new Nintendo Direct is reportedly on the horizon, specifically focusing on third-party titles, which has gamers buzzing with excitement. Scheduled for February 5, this Partner Direct aims to showcase upcoming games for the Nintendo Switch and the recently launched Switch 2, highlighting the growing interest in third-party collaborations as the console gains traction in the market.
