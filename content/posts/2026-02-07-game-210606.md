In a significant move for the gaming industry, JetSynthesys has acquired the popular merge puzzle game EverMerge, which has generated over $350 million in lifetime revenue. This acquisition not only enhances JetSynthesys' portfolio but also marks a pivotal step in their strategy to expand their global gaming ecosystem. With EverMerge already ranking among the top 100 highest-grossing mobile games of all time, the potential for growth in emerging markets, particularly India, is immense.

Rajan Navani, Chairman & MD of JetSynthesys, emphasized the importance of this acquisition in bridging global intellectual properties with local insights. The company aims to leverage its expertise in community engagement and user acquisition to resonate with players across diverse cultures. As JetSynthesys continues to invest in EverMerge, the focus will be on delivering fresh experiences and content that keep players engaged and entertained.

This acquisition not only reinforces JetSynthesys' commitment to its player community but also showcases the evolving landscape of the gaming industry. As the company embarks on this journey, one can't help but wonder how they will innovate and adapt EverMerge to cater to new audiences worldwide.
