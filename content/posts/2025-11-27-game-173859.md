Pope Leo XIV recently shared his unconventional approach to the popular word game Wordle, revealing that he uses a different starting word each day instead of sticking to a single strategy. This insight not only showcases his playful side but also highlights a broader lesson in adaptability and creativity in problem-solving, which can be applied beyond games into our daily lives.

During a virtual meeting with young American Catholics, the Pope emphasized the importance of being intentional with technology, urging the youth to ensure that it serves their lives rather than the other way around. His comments on responsible AI usage further stress the need for balance in a world increasingly dominated by technology. As we navigate this digital landscape, how can we adopt more flexible strategies in both our personal and professional lives?
