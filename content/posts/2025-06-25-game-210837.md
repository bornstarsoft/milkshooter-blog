In the world of gaming, hidden features and unlockable content often add layers of excitement and discovery. One such intriguing secret lies in linking **Metroid Zero Mission** to **Metroid Fusion** on the Game Boy Advance. By connecting these two iconic titles with a link cable and holding down START + SELECT while booting up Fusion, players can unlock the exclusive Metroid Fusion picture gallery within Zero Mission. This clever crossover not only enhances the gameplay experience but also bridges the narratives of these beloved games.

For those who enjoy the convenience of modern gaming, the good news is that this gallery is already unlocked by default in the Nintendo Switch Online version of Metroid Zero Mission, provided you have access to the GBA app through the Expansion Pack. This makes it easier than ever for both new players and nostalgic fans to explore the rich lore and stunning visuals that the Metroid series has to offer.

As gaming technology continues to evolve, the ability to link games and unlock hidden features remains a cherished aspect of the gaming experience. What other secrets might be waiting to be discovered in your favorite titles?
