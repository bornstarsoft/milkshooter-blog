Stellar Blade studio Shift Up has made headlines once again by gifting its employees a remarkable package of rewards, including cash bonuses and high-end Apple products. Each of the approximately 300 staff members received a bonus of 5 million (around $3,400), along with a set of Apple AirPods Max and an Apple Watch, totaling over $4,000 in value per employee. This generous gesture not only acknowledges the hard work of the team but also reinforces the studio's commitment to nurturing talent within the gaming industry.

This isn't the first time Shift Up has shown appreciation for its employees. In previous years, the studio has provided various incentives, such as iPhone 14s and prepaid credit cards, demonstrating a consistent strategy to motivate and retain top talent. With the recent success of their game, Stellar Blade, and a promising IPO that raised 435 billion, Shift Up is clearly focused on maintaining a positive work environment while expanding its game portfolio.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, how will other companies respond to Shift Up's approach to employee rewards? Will we see a trend towards more generous compensation packages in the tech world? Only time will tell.
