Konami is set to delight fans with the release of a 13-game Goemon collection this summer, bringing classic titles to Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PC. Scheduled for launch on July 2, this compilation will feature beloved entries from the Famicom, Super Famicom, and Game Boy eras, making it a nostalgic treasure trove for gamers. However, it appears that this collection will initially be exclusive to Japan, as it was announced during the recent Nintendo Direct focused on the Japanese market.

The collection promises to enhance the gaming experience with new features such as rewind, quick save, and turbo buttons, alongside a music player and a gallery showcasing each game's instruction manual. With titles like "The Legend of the Mystical Ninja" and "Ganbare Goemon 3," players can expect a mix of humor and engaging gameplay that has defined the series. As we look forward to its release, one can't help but wonder if Konami will consider a global launch for this nostalgic gem in the future.
