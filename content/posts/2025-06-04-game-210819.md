Whether you're into narrative-driven adventures or strategic puzzles, there's something for everyone in this latest batch.

First on the list is **The Falling Star**, a first-person walking simulator that invites players to embark on a deeply personal journey. As you follow a girl's quest to fulfill her mother's last wish, you'll uncover the mysteries surrounding her missing aunt in a beautifully crafted dreamscape.

For those seeking action, **Sporeborne** offers a thrilling hack-and-slash experience where you play as a mutated fungus on a quest for power and survival. Meanwhile, **Obgoose** provides a relaxing word game experience reminiscent of Scrabble, perfect for those who enjoy a non-competitive challenge.
