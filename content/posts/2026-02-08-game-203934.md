If youre a fan of puzzle games but often find yourself overwhelmed by their complexity, then Botany Manor is a delightful alternative thats currently free on the Epic Games Store. This cozy first-person puzzle game invites players to step into the shoes of botanist Arabella Greene, who explores a Victorian manor to complete her botanical research. Unlike many challenging puzzle games that can leave you feeling frustrated, Botany Manor strikes a balance between engaging puzzles and a relaxing atmosphere, making it perfect for casual gamers.

The developers have crafted an experience that emphasizes exploration and discovery without the pressure of overly difficult challenges. Lead developer Laure De May has highlighted the importance of creating a peaceful setting, where the challenge lies in the number of clues and steps rather than in the puzzles themselves. This thoughtful design has resonated well with players, as evidenced by positive reviews on Steam, which praise the game for its accessibility and charm.

As Botany Manor continues to capture the hearts of gamers, it raises an interesting question: how do we define the success of a puzzle game? Is it the difficulty, the story, or perhaps the joy of exploration? With titles like Botany Manor, it seems that the answer may lean towards creating a welcoming environment for all players.
