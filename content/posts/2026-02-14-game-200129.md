The 2026 Taipei International Game Show was a vibrant showcase of gaming culture, and the "Dolls Frontline 2: Exilium" booth stood out as a highlight for fans and attendees alike. With a plethora of talented cosplayers embodying beloved characters, the booth not only attracted attention but also created a lively atmosphere where fans could engage directly with the games universe.

Among the standout moments was the impressive display of cosplayers, including a stunning portrayal of "Macchiato" and the playful "Sentau Lacey" in a swimsuit. The interactive memory puzzle game added an exciting layer to the experience, rewarding players based on their commander level within the app. This blend of gaming and cosplay truly encapsulated the spirit of community and creativity that events like these foster.

As we reflect on the success of the Dolls Frontline 2 booth, one can't help but wonder what other innovative experiences the gaming industry will bring to future conventions. Will we see even more immersive interactions and creative displays? Only time will tell.
