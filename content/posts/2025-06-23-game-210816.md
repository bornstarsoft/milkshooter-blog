In a recent interview, Kosuke Yabuki, the producer of Mario Kart World, shared insights into the decision-making process behind the game's character roster. Unlike previous entries that featured crossover characters from other Nintendo franchises, Mario Kart World focuses solely on the Super Mario universe. Yabuki explained that the development team felt adding characters from other games would disrupt the game's cohesive Mario-themed world, emphasizing that they wanted players to enjoy the rich variety of characters already available within the Mario franchise.

This decision has sparked discussions among fans, especially considering the popularity of crossover characters in games like Super Smash Bros. However, Yabuki reassured players that the vast array of new racers, including the surprisingly beloved Cow, offers plenty of excitement and variety. The team aimed to create a unique experience that resonates with long-time fans while still surprising them with fresh content.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how future titles balance nostalgia with innovation. Will we see more franchises embrace their core identities like Mario Kart World, or will the trend of crossovers continue to dominate?
