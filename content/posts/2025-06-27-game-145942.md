Capcom's upcoming title, Pragmata, is set to redefine the gaming landscape with its innovative puzzle-shooting gameplay. Revealed in a recent gameplay video, players will engage in a unique blend of hacking robots through a puzzle mini-game while simultaneously dodging and shooting at them. This dual-action mechanic promises to deliver a fresh experience that challenges both strategic thinking and reflexes.

Set in a near-future lunar research station facing a crisis, players will step into the shoes of Hugh, a combat-ready spaceman, alongside his enigmatic android companion, Diana. The game's intriguing narrative and character dynamics are sure to captivate players as they navigate through its challenges. Despite its multiple delays since its announcement in 2020, the anticipation surrounding Pragmata continues to grow, especially after positive impressions from early gameplay previews.

As we look ahead to its release in 2026, one can't help but wonder how Capcom will expand upon these initial ideas over the course of what is expected to be a lengthy gaming experience. Will Pragmata live up to the high expectations set by Capcom's impressive track record? Only time will tell.
