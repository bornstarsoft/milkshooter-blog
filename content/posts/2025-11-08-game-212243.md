In a recent update, BioWare has reassured fans that the next installment in the beloved Mass Effect series is still very much in development. Despite concerns stemming from EA's impending sale to private investors and a reduction in BioWare's development team, executive producer Mike Gamble emphasized that the team is fully committed to crafting new stories within this iconic universe.  

Gamble's comments come after a period of relative silence since the teaser release two years ago, during which fans have been left eager for news. He acknowledged the community's concerns and confirmed that the team is focused on delivering an exciting new chapter for players, hinting at the vast universe and rich narratives yet to be explored.  

As we await more updates, the excitement surrounding the next Mass Effect game continues to grow. Will it live up to the legacy of its predecessors? Only time will tell, but for now, fans can rest easy knowing that BioWare is hard at work behind the scenes.
