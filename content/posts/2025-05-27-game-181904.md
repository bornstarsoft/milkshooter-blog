In a bold move that has caught the attention of gamers worldwide, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, *ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard*, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This statement not only highlights the developer's confidence but also taps into the long-standing desire for a true sequel to one of the most beloved puzzle games of all time. With *ChromaGun 2*, they aim to fill that void, even if the gameplay may remind players more of *Qube* than *Portal*.

The game features a first-person puzzle-solving experience where players utilize a unique gun to change the colors of various objects, reminiscent of the vibrant aesthetics found in *Portal*. However, the setting and narrative seem to diverge from the dark humor of Aperture Science, offering a more voluntary testing environment. This fresh take could attract both fans of the original *ChromaGun* and newcomers looking for innovative puzzle mechanics.

With the original *ChromaGun* receiving 'Mostly Positive' reviews since its 2016 release, expectations are high for this sequel. As the gaming community eagerly awaits its launch, the question remains: can *ChromaGun 2* carve out its own identity while honoring the legacy of *Portal*? Only time will tell, but the excitement surrounding this indie title is palpable.
